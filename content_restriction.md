# Content Restriction

## Content Restriction for Axis Subscription

This plugin restricts non registered users to view subscription plans. You can restrict content to registered users only.

If no subscription plans are selected, the page is available to all users whether they are subscribers or not or logged in or not.

If one subscription plan is selected, only users logged in with that subscription level will be able to view the page.
